Hello! This is the Blog / Documentation Website for the 2015-2016 Robomagellan
project in IEEE at UCSD. The purpose of this site will be to record and document
our progress-taking note of our struggles and successes along the way.

The Robomagellan project at UCSD is to build a self-driving car to compete in the Sparkfun
hosted, Autonomous Vehicle Competition, or AVC. The detailed rules to the
competition can be found at the Sparkfun website, located
[here](https://avc.sparkfun.com/2015/rules). In general, the competition
involves navigating a completely autonomous vehicle around four waypoints,
finishing the course in under five minutes. To add to this, points are awarded
for navigating through some obstacles including a hoop, a barrel, and a ramp.
Additionally, extra points are rewarded if the car uses no form of GPS to
navigate the course.

There are four different classes of vehicle which the competition is broken up
into:

* Micro/PBR: Budget for vehicle is less than $350, or it has dimensions smaller
  than 10"x6"x4"
* Doping: Budget is over $1000, or the vehicle is 25 pounds or more.
* Non-Traditional Locomotion: Class for vehicles which don't use wheels as their
 primary source of movement.
* Peloton: The remaining vehicles which don't fit into any of the above classes.


As the 2016 Robomagellan team, we have decided to place ourselves in the Doping
class.

Note that all of the above information is based off of the rules for the 2015
AVC event. The rules may differ moving into the 2016 event, but it should be
safe to assume that they will be similar if not identical.
