*Major: Electrical Engineering*

*Biography*: I joined the IEEE@UCSD Robomagellan Project because robotics
development is the intersection of my favorite interests and my favorite
environment. My passion is with constructing electronics, but I maintain
practiced interest in both software and mechanical design. Robotics incorporates
all three: electronics, software, and mechanics. Robotics development also
requires skilled individuals and different practices to collaborate, forming a
product development team. I love working with a product development team because
of the high energy environment and great potential. Heck, my life is a sort of
product development team, my experiences are the ever-changing product and
everyone I interact with are the development team. What could be better than
spending my life developing robots?


To help us complete our task, we've split our team into three main sub-teams:
