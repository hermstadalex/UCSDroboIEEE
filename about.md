Hello! This is the Blog / Documentation Website for the 2015-2016 Robomagellan
project in IEEE at UCSD. The purpose of this site will be to record and document
our progress; taking note of our struggles and successes along the way.
  
To help us complete our task, we've split our team into three main sub-teams:

## Software

## Hardware

## Peripherals
