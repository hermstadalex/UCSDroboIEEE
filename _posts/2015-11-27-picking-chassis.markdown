During practice #7 on Monday, November 23, the hardware and peripherals teams
discussed their ideas and thought processes for what type of chassis and sensors
we should consider for our project.

## Chassis Selection

The hardware team stated that their main concerns for choosing a chassis were
three things:

* Consistency
* Movement
* Specifications

Based on these three attributes, they decided that the best option was to modify
an already existing Remote Control car chassis. 


## Peripherals Selection

The peripherals team first discussed which types of sensors they had been
considering. The main first choice was ultrasonic sensors. These had a price
range going all the way from $10-$200. One of the main problems they brought up
was that dust could interfere with the ultrasonic readings.
  
The team decided that infrared sensors would not be very effective, as sunny
weather conditions might interfere heavily with their readings. The other type
of sensor considered was Lidar, which typically was very expensive, but there
was a possible cheaper version for $120.
  
The next point of discussion was what type of camera to use for machine vision
purposes. Three options were presented:

* GoPro
* xBox Kinect
* Webcam
  
It was decided that hacking an xBox Kinect may prove too difficult and time
consuming, so the choice is between using a Webcam or a GoPro. A Webcam may
prove to be less expensive, but more research will have to be done to determine
the specifications for the camera to be chosen.
  
Next, the idea of determining position was discussed. It was clear that a GPS
module would be necessary, and a gyroscope peripheral may also help to determine
the headings for the vehicle. The other option discussed was using wheel sensors
to determine rotations and the absolute position of the vehicle.
  
## Conclusion
  
While it is early in the process, much headway was made on the choosing of a
chassis and necessary peripherals. There is more research to be done on the
specifics, and there are a lot of interdependencies between the software,
hardware, and peripherals teams, but the choices have been greatly narrowed
down.
