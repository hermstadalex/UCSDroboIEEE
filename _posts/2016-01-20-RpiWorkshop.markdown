This practice served primarily as a Raspberry Pi 2 Workshop but time was also
spent communicating sub-team progress and working within sub-teams.

 

## Updates

Software

-   Set up Rpi2

    -   Wifi is up

    -   All software parts are in

Peripherals

-   Continued bill of materials research

Fundraising

-   The D’lush opportunity has an open calendar

    -   We will probably need flyers and t-shirts to fundraise

 

## Sub-team Work

SST set themselves up and prepared to lead the exploration of the two Rpis.
Karina as DST (the documentation sub-team) started T-shirt designs. HST
inspected the chassis kit, found that they would need a hobby knife and Allen
wrench set, and added those tools plus purchasing links to their bill of
materials. PST worked with Wilfred to purchase their parts and found that the
least expensive Lidar was no longer in stock. In response, PST purchased the
more expensive Lidar scheduled to arrive sooner while compensating price by
purchasing fewer Maxbotix Ultrasonic sensors.

 

## Raspberry Pi 2 Workshop

SST had planned to finish the workshop by performing very basic computer vision
operations using openCV but setup was taking longer than expected. When the
workshop started 30 minutes before the end of practice, it turned into a
demonstration because one monitor was available and only one Rpi2 could be used.
Everybody gathered around, the end of the table while SST explained how to use
the Rpi2. Demonstrations included how to: turn on and shut down the Rpi2,
connect to the internet with the WiPi, and use basic camera commands.
