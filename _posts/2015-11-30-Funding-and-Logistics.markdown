title:  "Practice #8: Funding and Project Logistics"

During the team's 8th and final practice before the end of the winter quarter,
much of the time was spent discussing methods of funding the project as well as
the logistics behind travelling to Colorado for the competition in the summer.

## Funding

With our platform, chassis, and peripherals roughly picked out, it was then
possible to make a rough estimation on the costs from each portion of the
project. The cost distribution is roughly as follows:

* Hardware - $700
* Peripherals - $700
* Software - $600

During the practice, the decision was also made to purchase two Navio+ platforms
as well as two Raspberry Pis. The thought behind from this decision came mostly
from the fact that this would allow us to do parallel development on each
platoform, and if something went wrong with one, we would have a backup ready
for use.

## Travel Logistics

With a limited amount of funding, our aim as a team was to keep the vehicle cost
close to $2000 to maintain enough money for travel funds for those who could
participate in the competition.

When considering our options of travel and housing, it was determined that we
had a couple choices: 

### Travel Options

* Flying to Colorado
* Taking multiple cars and driving
* Renting a van for multiple people

### Housing Options

* Possibly staying with friends if anyone knew people in the area
* Renting a house for the duration of the stay
* Paying for hotel rooms

At this point, it was clear that the given funding would not be enough to pay
for all of us to travel and have housing, so it was determined that additional
money would have to be raised. For this purpose, we created a funding sub-team.

## Additional Funding Methods

Some different methods were brainstormed for how more money could be raised for
the project. Roughly $1000 more is needed to account for all of our travel
expenses. Some ideas discussed were to contact GoPro for funding, get in touch
with Atmel who was willing to possibly sponsor with materials for the project,
or possibly take a simpler approach and sell things to raise more money. 

As we do not yet have parts for the project, the discussions are still mostly in
the planning stage, but these discussions are crucial to the success and
fluidity of moving forward successfully.
