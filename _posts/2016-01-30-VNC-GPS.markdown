Updates
-------

-   More parts: The pinion gears arrived damaged

-   Rpi2 case does not fit when the Navio+ is connected. Need a custom case
    afterall.

-   OpenCV fails to compile when issuing “make”

-   Wilfred brought his Rpi2 (because SST’s Rpi would be busy compiling OpenCV)

 

Daily Objectives
----------------

Today’s objectives were not predefined other than to continue working in
sub-teams and maintain last practice’s momentum, so during the first 10 minutes
of practice sub-teams defined their specific objectives. SST should continue
troubleshooting OpenCV and ensure they learn to use SSH and VNC. PST should
continue learning Mission Planner and work to get an accurate GPS reading. HST
should diagnose missing pinion gears and work on the Rpi2/Navio+ custom case.

Progress Reflection
-------------------

SST

-   Since the busy Rpi2 was using the only monitor, Wilfred proposed learning
    SSH. He found AngryIP as a solution to identify the dynamic IP of the Rpi
    when connected via ethernet/RJ45 to the computer then SST used this tool and
    successfully connected to the Rpi using SSH. With PST’s help everyone on SST
    was also able to view the LXDE gui through the VNC protocol.

-   Alex restarted the steps to make sure everything was installed correctly.
    This time around python wasn't cooperating and apparently Raspbian needed to
    be reinstalled. Alex worked on reinstalling Raspbian and then setting up an
    OpenCV installation script. 

-   Wilfred and Clark looked at pin and power requirements for the Lidar sensor

-   Alec looked at RDP to replace VNC and successfully connected to the Rpi2
    desktop using XRDP and the windows remote desktop viewer client.

PST

-   Alexander and Chris found TightVNC as a VNC remote desktop viewing client.

-   Alexander and Chris installed APM Planner 2.0, connected the Rpi2 to the
    computer, ran an arp scan from the Rpi2 in order to find the ground station
    software address, and observed inputs from the IMU using the interactive
    flight data calibration screen.

-   PST could not get a successful GPS fix during practice while working inside
    the project space.

-   Alexander and Chris finally submitted their written biographies for the team
    website.

-   After practice, everyone thought we couldn't get the GPS to work. We sat
    outside Jacobs and Alexander changed a FlightPlanner parameter, but the
    coordinates stayed constant and over the Atlantic coast of Africa. Alexander
    and Alec then went inside and noticed some coordinates were plotted just
    outside Jacob's School. They changed the map update intervals and went
    outside again. Standing by the grass Alexander and Alec noticed the system
    connecting to satellites and so they started walking around Warren Hall. The
    GPS maxed at 12 satellite fixes and then captured plenty \<5m accurate
    coordinate points.

HST

-   Sanil and Jeffry observed the remaining pinion gears and determined that a
    new pack was needed because pinion gears affect the power output from the
    motors to the wheels. Jeffry ordered the second pack of pinion gears.

-   The chassis was as completed as possible without the pinion gears, motor, or
    battery.

-   Sanil began measuring some chassis dimensions needed to design a peripherals
    surface mount. The calipers needed coin batteries so those were purchased.

-   With inspiration from Thingiverse Jeffry completed the Navio+/Rpi2 case
    schematic.

FST

Alec added his receipts to the google document collection and then submitted
both his and Wilfred's multiple receipts as two bulk requests.

The bill of materials was updated.

-   Current submitted and received reimbursements were checked off.

-   Deleted encoders, hobby knife, and charger while adding the second pinion
    gear order to reflect purchasing decisions.
