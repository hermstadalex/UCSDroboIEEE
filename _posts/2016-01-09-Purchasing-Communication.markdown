## Finishing Fall Quarter Objectives

Before the start of winter quarter, sub-teams were supposed to replace the
makeshift bill of materials with their thorough parts lists, parts were supposed
to be ordered, and website bios were expected to be online. Progress was made
for each of these objectives during practice \#9:

* **Bill of materials**:
    The software bill of materials was practically identical to the makeshift
    bill of materials; the entire software sub-team decided only to include a
    case and remove the USB hub. Jeffry worked on the hardware bill of materials
    adding an RC system and wheels while specifying a more appropriate motor,
    servo, and battery. Alexander and Christian worked on the peripherals bill
    of materials noting the specific characteristics of the included GPS and IMU
    in the Navio+.

*   **Ordering parts**:
    Even though getting parts was last quarters objective most of fall practices
    were spent discussing logistics, so during this practice ordering parts was
    a high priority. Plus, everybody wanted to start working. The first parts to
    arrive needed to be immediately useful. Orders were placed for the
    hardware’s chassis kit, software's Raspberry Pi and Navio+ components, and
    peripheral’s Pi Camera components. When purchasing the Navio+ there was the
    complication of the Navio+ being replaced with the Navio2. The Navio2 was
    intriguing so the team discussed its pros and cons but in the end purchased
    the Navio+.
    
    -   Pros: It includes updated modules and might arrive sooner (isn’t
        blacklisted like Navio+)

    -   Cons: It has possible less documentation and is slightly more expensive.
* **Website Bios**

    Bios were supposed to be completed before the start of winter quarter in
    order to add a more personalized front to our team. Clark, Jeffry, Chris,
    and Alexander spent time finishing their bios, but the former two forgot to
    save and submit their work.

## Restructuring Communications

More clear progress communication would be necessary when working with parts and
was clearly needed when sub-teams could not finish their bills of materials.
Some time today was spent discussing the logistics of communications in order to
both remedy what happened last quarter and to prepare for the upcoming winter
quarter.

* **Sub-team roles**:
       Up to this point, the entire team has spent practices discussing together
    but when we start working with parts everyone’s attention will be split.
    Alec lectured the importance of sub-teams coordinating their efforts with
    one and other by using sub-team leads as liaisons.
   
   * **Trello**:
    To promote sub-team coordination and progress tracking Alec introduced
        the tool Trello. With Trello, the entire team should record and identify
        their objectives as either “Todo” “In Progress” and “Done.”
   * **Practice Schedules**:
        Being the first practice of the quarter, time was also spent filling out
        a WhenIsGood and deciding that weekly winter practices would be on
        Wednesdays.
