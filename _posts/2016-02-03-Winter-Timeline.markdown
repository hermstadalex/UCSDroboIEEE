title: "Practice #15: Establishing a Winter Quarter Timeline"
---

Updates
-------

-   All biographies are now on the team website.

-   OpenCV installation remains uncooperative and incomplete

-   About one month of practice summaries are incomplete and not live on the
    website.

 

Daily Objectives
----------------

Today’s main objective was to establish a timeline thanks to Ian’s advice to
Alec during their last project meeting. Next everyone should finish their work
from last practice and then work towards the impeding timeline tasks. It was
decided that SST would recontact the Coordinated Robotics Lab and continue
trying to install OpenCV, PST would become more familiar with APM Planner, HST
would order parts, and DST would work on the practice summaries.

 

Progress Reflection
-------------------

### Timeline:

The timeline goal was to finish a controllable powered vehicle and be testing by
the start of spring quarter. Alec subdivided this task into three objectives:
build, integrate Rpi2/Navio+, prepare GPS run. The rest of the team proposed
steps to complete each of the three objectives and Alexander clarified their
relative priority. The resulting timeline:
