During the fifth practice of winter quarter we continued to familiarize
ourselves with newly received parts:

-   Both Navio+ and their components

-   Parallax Lidar

-   Savox High Torque Servo

-   Front and Rear wheels

 

SST Alec and Clark emailed two UCSD contacts in search of potential OpenCV
mentors while Alex set OpenCV to compile for the duration of practice. Then
Alex, Wilfred, and Clark followed the online learning courses. After Alec
finished learning about the [Coordinated Robotics Lab at
UCSD](<http://fccr.ucsd.edu/>) he and Wilfred started a receipts collection for
reimbursements. At the end of practice it was discovered that the OpenCV
installation had failed early on due to some dependency issue.

PST Alexander, Chris, and Karina hand screwed the Navio+ to the Rpi2 via its
headers, connected the GPS antenna, then installed Emlidâ€™s Navio+ RTK Raspbian
image to the second Rpi2, powered the Rpi2 & Navio+, added lxde, and made sure
SSH was working. PST also researched VNC solutions to share the desktop over the
SSH protocol. Karina also finalized here T-shirt design ideas.

HST Jeffry installed all four wheels onto the chassis and mounted the servo.
