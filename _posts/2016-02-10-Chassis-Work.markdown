Updates
-------

- New parts: Batteries, Motor, and Allen wrench arrived. Also the Y-splitters,
  adapters, and connectors arrived.

- New Orders:
   * 2x Hobbywing BECs were purchased because the motor ESC does not provide
     output for the receiver or servo.
   * 2 parallel XT60 Y-splitters were purchased to connect the BECs and ESC in
     parallel to the motor.
   * A pack of 5 Dean’sT to XT60 adapters were purchased as a makeshift solution
     for the different connectors of the Navio+ PowerModule and the batteries.
   * A pack of 5pair XT60 connectors were purchased to solder onto every module
     in the power system once the makeshift solution stops working.

- ** Website: ** The most recent practice summaries are now live on the website.
  Alec didn’t push them to the git repository correctly so they have formatting
  errors with the title and do not properly show images within the host
directory.

Daily Objectives
----------------

Our plan was to finish the chassis, to connect the radio receiver to the Navio+
servo rail and configure it and the radio control, and to educate ourselves
about the sensor pin outs of the Navio+

Progress Reflection
-------------------

** Software: **

** Hardware: **

* Alec and Alex continued building the chassis from step G3 where Jeffry had
  left off. They fastened on the servo with difficulty while learning the
importance of pre-tapping an unthreaded plastic hole. Then they installed the
servo tierod that connects the servo to the front axle allowing steering. It
took 1hr to get this far. Alec then attempted to install the pinion gear but
found that all of the gears in the packet had diameters too small (3mm) for the
motor shaft (5mm.) As a side note, the motor cannot be installed unless the
servo tierod is temporarily removed to make room. Next Alec tried to solder the
ESC wires to the motor leads, but he couldn’t find the solder.

** Peripherals: **

* Alexander tried to make receiver work, but no power to receiver. Tried to
  power from controller but it wasn’t enough power. Voltmeter difference when
testing pins, but was very insignificant (0.2 V). Alex and Wilfred began
schematics for hooking up sensors to computer.
