Today’s practice will start with Alec sharing Oren’s knowledge about choosing a
control platform. The rest of practice will be used to continue researching
control platforms appropriate for the AVC competition.

We continued to research platforms on this google doc educated ourselves about
general autonomous vehicle technology like the google’s self driving cars, and
created a second Whenisgood in order to reschedule the best fall quarter
practice times. The platforms that we have considered include:

* BeagleBone Black / Raspberry Pi
* Pixhawk(PX42)
* Intel Galileo Gen 2
* mbed
* ErleBrain2

If we run into a lack of I/O pins or the need for a simpler I/O platform, these
are our current microcontroller choices:

* Arduino
* Parallax Propeller
* ATmega16/162
