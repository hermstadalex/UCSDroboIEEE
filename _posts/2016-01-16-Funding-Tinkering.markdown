Last Wednesday there was no practice since no work could be done until parts
arrived. By Friday enough parts had arrived:

-   Team Losi Racing 22-4 RC chassis kit

-   Two Raspberry Pi 2s and their USB power supplies

-   WiPi Wireless LAN adapter

-   Raspberry Pi Camera Board and its extension cords

-   Pi View HDMI-VGA

 

Outreach and Fundraising
------------------------

At the start of Saturday’s practice Christian as FST (the funding sub-team)
informed everyone about multiple possible outreach opportunities

-   A UCSD TedX event. It would require an interactive presentation (course
    demonstration? audience control vehicle?) and be sometime in May but we
    would need to commit one month in advance.

-   A Dlush fundraising deal

We decided to pursue the Dlush fundraiser but not commit to the TedX event until
our project progresses further.

Next, SST (the software sub-team) and PST (the peripheral sub-team) began to
familiarize themselves with the Rpis. Although there were two, only one was used
because there was only one monitor in the Project Space. We had assumed that the
RPI used an SD card but it required a microSD card, so Wilfred, Alec, and
Alexander went to buy a microSD card and collect Alexander’s microSD card
adapter. Meanwhile, Alex researched installing Raspian on the Rpi2 and
documented the day, no one on HST (the hardware sub-team) was present so the
chassis went unused, and PST had little to do so Christian touched up the bill
of materials.

Wilfred, Alec, and Alexander returned with the microSD card adapter 30 before
the end of practice. Christian had left early. We flashed the microSD with a
Raspbian image and connected the Rpi2 to the internet using the WiPi before
practice ended. At 2:00 Alexander left at while Wilfred, Alec, and Alex stayed
later to test out the camera. The three remained for an extra hour and were able
to take a photo using PiCamera and its [official python
library](<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/python/README.md>).
Before leaving, Wilfred suggested that the next practice be spent educating the
rest of the team about the Rpi2 and our progress.
