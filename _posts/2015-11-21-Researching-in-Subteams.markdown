Attendance: Alec, Alex, Alexander, Chris, Clark, Jeffry, Karina, Sanil, Wilfred

## Updates
* Four sub-teams of software, peripherals, hardware, and documentation have been
  formed to encourage simultaneous progress.
* Alex and Sanil can only attend the first hour of practice

## Daily Objectives:

Today’s objective is for members to do research within their sub-teams for the
first time.
   
## Progress Reflection:

* Software is responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining software
  on the RPI2/Navio+. Today they became familiar with RPI2 basics and focused on
how to install and run Linux.
* Peripherals is responsible for choosing the sensors for our vehicle in order
  to meet our team and competition goals. They are also responsible for
maintaining the sensors and having a working knowledge of how to operate the
sensors. Today they researched what sensors are not included with the Navio+ but
necessary for our project goals and how to operate those sensors’ for best
performance.
* Hardware is responsible for choosing, building, and maintaining the vehicle
  chassis. Today they researched the best chassis characteristics for the AVC
competition and shopped for products matching those specifications.
* Documentation is responsible for recording practice progress summaries. Today
  they wrote a summary about last practice’s choice to use the RaspberryPi and
Navio+ as our control platform.
