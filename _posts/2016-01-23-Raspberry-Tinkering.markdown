Todayâ€™s plan was for everyone to self organize since Alec was absent. Only four
people showed up. The first 10 minutes were spent communicating sub-team
updates, the whole of practice was for sub-team work, and the final 10 minutes
were spent reflecting. During practice SST continued working to install OpenCV
and PST got SSH running on the second Rpi2 to bypass dependency on a second
monitor. SST discovered that compiling OpenCV takes \>2h and found the
[AngryIp](http://angryip.org/)tool to help identify the dynamic Rpi2 address
when connected to a computer. It should be noted that although HST was absent,
Jeffry had been coming into the Project Space on his own time during the week
before and had built most of the chassis skeleton leaving only wheels, servo,
motor, and power to be added.
