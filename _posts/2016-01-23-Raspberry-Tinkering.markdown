## Daily Objectives:
   Being the first practice, today's objectives are to get to know each other,
familiarize ourselves with the [SparkFun's AVC Competition](https://avc.sparkfun.com/), finish registering for IEEE, and set up [Slack](https://slack.com/) for communication.

## Progress Reflection:
To get to know each other we played a partner learning game. For each pair one
partner held 6 pieces of Reese’s and the other held 6 pieces of Starburst. The
game required partners to learn about each other’s personality by revealing
biographies and asking hypotheticals such as “What’s your ideal vacation
destination?” The plan was that partners exchanged a candy for every piece of
learned information so that partners would have both candies by the end of the
game, instead everyone ended up switching candies.
   
After introductions, the whole team watched the [AVC 2015 Recap
Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ3fpZFWHDM) and discussed basic elements
of the project. Next Sanil, Wilfred, Alexander, Alex, and Alec To get to know
