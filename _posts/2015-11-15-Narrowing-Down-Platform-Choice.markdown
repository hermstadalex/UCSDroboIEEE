Attendance: Alec, Alex, Alexander, Chris, Sanil, Wilfred

## Updates
* Alec attended an OpenCV workshop offered by The UCSD Data Science Student
  Society and asked the guest presenter Jianfeng Ren about machine vision on
  embedded devices.
* Oren commented on the team's current platform research. He likes the
  ErleBrain2 for its APM and ROS compatibility but is hesitant because of its
recent release. He suggests that instead of the DragonBoard we consider the
Inforce 6410Plus because it has a larger user base and ROS documentation. He
also points out that a simpler I/O platform should only be used to accommodate
an on-board computer if that computer needs analog signals to be translated.
Alec inquires about most useful types of pin inputs and outputs for an on-board
computer.

## Daily Objectives:
[Pratice's
Powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vd7GRl5eWh0uci9uSAD_STtZdWhhNBF9mCnDkbRHZ8M/edit?usp=sharing)

Today’s practice will start with Alec sharing Jianfeng’s knowledge about
applying machine vision using embedded computers. Then we will reiterate our
project goals, have each member pitch the pro's and con's of their researched
controllers, and choose a controller. Finally, we will divide into sub-teams to
meet the requirements of our project/learning objectives and each team will
develop weekly plans to achieve those goals.
   
## Progress Reflection:

   We started by updating the platform research document by adding the
Inforce6410 Plus and DragonBoard 410C and removing the simpler microcontrollers.
Since some of the team was missing we decided not to make the platform decision,
but instead narrow the choice down to three platforms based on their ability to
meet our goals. Those three were the RPI2, ErleBrain2, and Inforce6410 Plus. We
also couldn’t split into sub-teams today.
