Attendance: Alec, Alex, Alexander, Chris, Clark, Jeffry, Karina, Sanil, Wilfred

## Updates

* Alec contacts Oren through Ian and asked for advice about the project
  timeline, team organization, and competition strategy. Oren suggested that our
timeline be determined by team goals, that the best organization comes from
strong individual motivation (when members choose to align their roles with
their interests), and that our competition strategy should focus on simply
completing a lap around four corners. To start the project, Oren suggested that
we prioritize getting a controller and parts so that later we can test early. To
educate ourselves he also suggested that anyone programming start this [AI
Udacity
course](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373).
* Everyone wrote a Slack post in the #social channel showing their excitement
  for Robomagellan (except for Jeffry). 
* Everyone reviewed how their personal goals might concur with the SparkFun AVC
  competition. 
* We collected information about past AVC competitions like blogs and videos to
  kickstart competition research. 

## Daily Objectives:

During practice #2 we will continue team building games, determine our project
goals, analyze AVC for the best competition strategy, as well as research past
AVC entrants' designs to help model our own design strategies.
   
## Progress Reflection:

With an [Agile](http://www.adfkickstart.com/agile-methodology) development
philosophy in mind, and application similar to [Feature Driven
Development](http://www.step-10.com/SoftwareProcess/FeatureDrivenDevelopment/),
we used the beginning of practice to define our overall goals and break them
into features organized by difficulty. Our single largest goal/epic this year is
to use the vehicle as a learning environment for every member, not necessarily
place first in the AVC 2016 competition. The single largest learning experience
desired by the team is programming skills specifically how to integrate machine
vision and GPS. Other learning goals include making a chassis and designing a
board from the ground up, but Alec communicated that these goals must wait to be
considered until the team already has a functioning vehicle. As for the
competition our goals are split into three features:

* Likely: Using basic sensors and maybe GPS to finish a lap without crashing
* Demanding: Focusing on GPS to complete a lap more quickly while interacting
  with a track object, maybe using simple machine vision.
* Challenging: Using advanced machine vision techniques and control system
  theory to go through the hoop, maybe even dead reckon the track.

Next we took a break and played a hypothetical zombie apocalypse game as a team
building exercise. We resumed by learning about the importance of our vehicleâ€™s
control platform. Then we had an outdoor activity to simulate the importance of
an effective control platform and gain an intuitive understanding of the
competition. Pairs navigated a blindfolded partner around the trees and grass
outside Jacobs Hall. We learned that reliable movement is paramount and that
simple controls are best. Finally we came inside and chose to compete in the
peloton vehicle class before ending practice.
