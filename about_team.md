*Major: Electrical Engineering*

*Year: Second Year*

*Biography*: I joined the IEEE@UCSD Robomagellan Project because robotics
development is the intersection of my favorite interests and my favorite
environment. My passion is with constructing electronics, but I maintain
practiced interest in both software and mechanical design. Robotics incorporates
all three: electronics, software, and mechanics. Robotics development also
requires skilled individuals and different practices to collaborate, forming a
product development team. I love working with a product development team because
of the high energy environment and great potential. Heck, my life is a sort of
product development team, my experiences are the ever-changing product and
everyone I interact with are the development team. What could be better than
spending my life developing robots?

*Major: Computer Science*

*Year: Third Year / First Year Transfer*

*Biography*: I joined Robomagellan to get some hands-on experience with working
with something that combined hardware and software. The idea of using
programming to control a robot seemed like a fascinating idea to me, so I had to
choose Robomagellan.

*Major: Electrical Engineering*

*Year: Fourth Year*

*Biography*: I joined Robomagellan because throughout school, I have learned
about of theories and algorithms behind the topics of AI and computer vision. I
thought it would be neat to see how these would apply to an actual hands-on
project.

*Major: Electrical Engineering with Machine Learning and Power Electronics Focus*

*Year: Fourth Year*

*Biography*: I joined Robomagellan to work on a project where I can use my skills in machine learning and
solid work skills for designing and realizing custom parts.

*Major: Mechanical Engineering*

*Year: First Year*

*Biography*: I joined Robomagellan in order to gain first hand experience with
real robotics. In high school I was heavily involved in FIRST competitions and
wanted to continue my work with competitive robotics in college. Thus, I applied
to the Robomagellan project as it combined by experience with hardware design
and practical problem solving along with providing me an opportunity to gain
exposure to a variety of areas I had no experience in before such as working
with GPS and ultrasonic sensors.

*Major: Electrical Engineering*

*Year: Third Year*

*Biography*: Robomagellen is a great opportunity to learn and practice new
skills. Robots have always been an interest of mine, so I'm glad I get to pursue
it. I also get to work on an awesome team.

*Major: Electrical Engineering*

*Year: Third Year*

*Biography*: I joined Robomagellan because I liked the idea of the competition
(creating an autonomous rover). I also wanted to gain experiencing working on a
project of this scale with people that have similar interests/goals.
